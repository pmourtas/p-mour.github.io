## Unit 1
<p><strong> Introduction to Big Data Technologies and Data Management </strong><br></p>
 
This unit had a lecturecast about big data, data types, and formats. I learn about the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of data and how they have grown and developed in the last few years. I also learn about technologies like data mining, exploration, analysis, and presentation. Methodologies and techniques like cleansing, standardization, formatting, and normalization, as well as tools and strategies like platforms, programming languages, and services that will make me able to handle the big data (1).

In this unit, we were required to start reading a great book about data wrangling with Python (2). From the very beginning, in chapter one, the book revealed the process of data wrangling. Moreover, it provided us with a brief overview of Python, showing us again all about lists, sets, strings, tuples, and dictionaries with a lot of solved examples and mechanisms for how to properly handle them in different scenarios.

Other than that, in this unit we had to start a discussion topic about the internet of things (IoT) (3). In that discussion, we had to highlight the opportunities, limitations, risks, and challenges in relation to data collection and determine appropriate measures in order to solve them appropriately, using academic literature. The discussion is held between the peers, and in the end, our tutor gives us his feedback in order to criticize our work and to help us develop our research skills even more.
