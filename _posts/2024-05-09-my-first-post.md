## Unit 1
<p><strong> Introduction to Big Data Technologies and Data Management </strong><br></p>
 
This unit had a lecturecast about big data, data types, and formats. I learn about the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of data and how they have grown and developed in the last few years. I also learn about technologies like data mining, exploration, analysis, and presentation. Methodologies and techniques like cleansing, standardization, formatting, and normalization, as well as tools and strategies like platforms, programming languages, and services that will make me able to handle the big data (1).

In this unit, we were required to start reading a great book about data wrangling with Python (2). From the very beginning, in chapter one, the book revealed the process of data wrangling. Moreover, it provided us with a brief overview of Python, showing us again all about lists, sets, strings, tuples, and dictionaries with a lot of solved examples and mechanisms for how to properly handle them in different scenarios.

Other than that, in this unit we had to start a discussion topic about the internet of things (IoT) (3). In that discussion, we had to highlight the opportunities, limitations, risks, and challenges in relation to data collection and determine appropriate measures in order to solve them appropriately, using academic literature. The discussion is held between the peers, and in the end, our tutor gives us his feedback in order to criticize our work and to help us develop our research skills even more.

## Unit 2
<p><strong> Introduction to Data Types and Formats </strong><br></p>

In this unit, we had only to continue our required reading concerning data wrangling with Python among two books (1, 2). We learn about data structures and how to handle the filling. We examine different user-defined methods, iterators, queues, stacks, and other usable methods in Python. Other than that, we familiarize ourselves with some library packages, such as the lambda expression and file-handling operations such as opening and closing files, as well as reading and writing to them. Other than that, we proceed further with the libraries of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, as well as their significant features, facilitating different methods.

As it concerns our new material, the second book, we learn about importing data tricks and techniques from specific format files like CSV, JSON, XML, and Excel, as well as some machine command lines, in order to navigate through our folders and files on our computers. That book helped us to comprehend the idea of parsing the data and how we wanted the data to be shown on our screen. It also helped us to find what we were looking for and what else we could actually do to get closer to a suitable solution, examining the numerous ways that Python and its libraries provided.
